# I Wont Let You Down
## OK Go take a look at this IP: Connect here: http://155.138.162.158

If you browse to the website you'll get... Yeah... Rick rolled

Let's run a nmap scan against the server.


```
Nmap scan report for 155.138.162.158.vultrusercontent.com (155.138.162.158)
Host is up (0.00013s latency).
Not shown: 504 closed tcp ports (reset), 493 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
8888/tcp open  sun-answerbook
```

If we try SSH we get a message this is out of the challenge... M'kay! 

Port 8888 seems interesting but we cannot browse to it. Either it throws an error or simply just hangs

Let's try with netcat

```bash

──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Desktop/nmapAutomator]
└─# nc 155.138.162.158 8888     
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
