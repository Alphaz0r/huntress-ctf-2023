A file is included with this challenge

Let's download the file.


Using `file` command on my Kali machine I got the info that the file is a [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) image. 

Opening the image with the tool, I've got an hint in the challenge name + the context that we have to check the different layers of the image to find something...


Flag is located at layer 3 (starting from the bottom).
