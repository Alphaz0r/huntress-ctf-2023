# Chicken Wings
## I ordered chicken wings at the local restaurant, but uh... this really isn't what I was expecting... 

A file is included with the challenge

---

Opening the file with my favourite IDE shows me this String

`♐●♋♑❀♏📁🖮🖲📂♍♏⌛🖰♐🖮📂🖰📂🖰🖰♍📁🗏🖮🖰♌📂♍📁♋🗏♌♎♍🖲♏❝`

After googling a bit I know that is this [wingdings font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings).

I searched for a [wingdings decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/wingdings-font) and after feeding him the String I got the flag!
