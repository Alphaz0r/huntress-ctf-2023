# Press play on tape
## While walking home through a dark alley you find an archaic 1980s cassette tape. It has "PRESS PLAY ON TAPE" written on the label. You take it home and play it on your old tape deck. It sounds awful. The noise made you throw your headphones to the floor immedately. You snagged a recording of it for analysis.

## WARNING: The audio in this file is very loud and obnoxious. Please turn your volume way down before playing.

A file is included with the challenge.

The file is just a wav file with weird sound in it. Googling a bit about press play on tape I find out that this is a Danish group using Commodore 64 sound to make music.

Hinted by the challenge, I guess I received a wav file and I need to convert back to the original file (the archaic 1980s cassette tape).

Using [this tool](https://github.com/nippur72/commodore-tap-wav) I managed to get a `.tap` file which seems to be a format accepted by a Commodore64. 

[This emulator](https://c64online.com/c64-online-emulator/) helped me read the file and get the flag.
