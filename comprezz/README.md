# Comprezz
## Someone stole my S's and replaced them with Z's! Have you ever seen this kind of file before?


A file is included containing a string


---


Let's download the file.

We see that comprezz archive is... Obviously, a compressed file but I cannot extract directly. Using uncompress I see that a suffix is missing...

The challenge context gives us a hint that S were replaced by Z, maybe let's rename the file with `.z` suffix ?
