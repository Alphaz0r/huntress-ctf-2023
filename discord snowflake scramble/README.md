# Discord Snowflake Scramble
## Someone sent message on a Discord server which contains a flag! They did mention something about being able to embed a list of online users on their own website...
## Can you figure out how to join that Discord server and see the message?
## Note: Discord phone verification is NOT required for this challenge.

When I clic to the link discord recognize the link but leads me to... Nothing.


Googling a bit about discord link, I discovered that the pattern is:

`https://discord.gg/ServerID/ChannelID/MessageID`

Knowing that, I tried to find a website that can find the Discord server via its ID.


I not only found [a website](https://discord-avatar.com/en/server/1156647699362361364) that does this but seems like he also has an invite link!


After joining the Discord server, the flag was in one channel.
